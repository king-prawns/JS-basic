# Design Patterns

## Module Pattern

JavaScript modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components. This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code.

## Revealing Module Pattern

A variation of the module pattern is called the Revealing Module Pattern. The purpose is to maintain encapsulation and reveal certain variables and methods returned in an object literal. The direct implementation looks like this:

## Prototype Pattern

The Prototype design pattern relies on the JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The prototype model is used mainly for creating objects in performance-intensive situations.

## Observer Pattern

There are many times when one part of the application changes, other parts needs to be updated. The observer pattern incorporates just that - if an object is modified it broadcasts to dependent objects that a change has occurred.

## Singleton

A Singleton only allows for a single instantiation, but many instances of the same object. The Singleton restricts clients from creating multiple objects, after the first object created, it will return instances of itself.
